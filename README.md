# Dotfiles

My super-basic dotfiles, with touches of Dracula.

## Summary

I don't consider myself much of a console-crusader, but I enjoy theming and ricing Linux as much as anyone else, and somewhere in here are a few genuinely useful tweaks. These files are also part of an Ansible Playbook I wrote to automate the process of taking a minimal Arch Linux install to a relatively functional tiling window manager environment with as little hassle as possible. Fair warning: my `.vimrc` is perpetually in a state of disarray.
